# ImageSegmentation
is the task of partitioning an image into multiple segments. In
semantic segmentation, all pixels that are part of the same object type get assigned to
the same segment.
For example, in a self-driving car’s vision system, all pixels that are
part of a pedestrian’s image might be assigned to the “pedestrian” segment (there
would just be one segment containing all the pedestrians).
